The purpose of our project was to enhance our data analysis skills by working with real-world datasets, learning and applying Enterprise Control Language (ECL) for efficient data processing, and developing a deeper understanding of data manipulation techniques. Additionally, this project provided an opportunity to collaborate as a team, improving our ability to communicate technical concepts, divide tasks effectively, and integrate our individual contributions into a cohesive final product. Through this experience, we aimed to strengthen our problem-solving abilities, gain hands-on experience with ECLâ€™s capabilities, and refine our approach to working with large-scale data processing systems.
